This is my Final Project for my CPSC349-Front End Engineering!

The website is a personal portfolio documenting projects I've done, skills, classes, and more

It isn't anything too fancy, but has the basics

**!Only works in the loadup window size, becomes glitchy when too large or too small! Sorry!**
